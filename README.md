# Essential concepts

The game is meant to feel like playing Pokemon and other classic JRPGs of old, combined with a multi-player team-focus derived from Pardus (or World of Warcraft).

The setting is generic "ancient times." Fantasy elements like magic and powers and monsters are rare/intended to be added in a later version.

The game is meant to be very competitive/harsh in nature in contrast to runescape where you basically live in your bubble and nothing you do has any consequences.

The game is not an "endless open world." It starts and ends in rounds (of say, 2 weeks). This is to prevent political stagnation and to make introducing new features easier.
