 Jonathan:  cuckcrusader.ninja
Dominandus sounds coolish but not perfect
powerstruggle is good in that it has the "General Electric" style of being the authority on a certain thing
maguffin makes me think of mcgyver the paperclip guy
draconem is cool but may be too intense
auctorita is to spanish of an ending (you probably want something germanic or old english sounding or perhaps east asian)
i have no opinion on arvum
 me:  autorita is latin for "power"
arvum is latin for "country"
 Jonathan:  what aboutL autora
although a latin word would be fine if you wanna spin the roman thing
 me:  i just do latin words because they sound cool usually
i mean, pardus is named after a cat, and travian is kind of a dumb name
so the competition here is not stiff
runescape - also lame
autora is too soft sounding
 Jonathan:  runescape is great for targeting middle schoolers
pardus and travian have uniqueness going for them and not much else
 me:  fuck middle schoolers. they don't have money
 Jonathan:  *phrasing
 me:  lol
dominandi > dominadus ?
dominandus*
 Jonathan:  I like autorita as a possible front runner
I always thought the ___us ending sounded more latin
 me:  it does
did you mean auctorita?
 Jonathan:  i don't know
"autorita is latin for "power"
arvum is latin for "country"
" -- Daniel Zapata 
 me:  oh
yeah I meant with the "c".. typo...
 Jonathan:  i see
actorita sounds a lot more like its about acting 
 me:  autorita sounds like author too much to me
 Jonathan:  auctorita*
 me:  auctorita does sound like acting a bit
but acting can mean drama or action/fighting
 Jonathan:  auctorita is good, arvum is good, but they are not particularly gripping 
 me:  meh.
whatever. we have a while to think on it
 Jonathan:  draconem has more grip to it
 Joel:  None of those
